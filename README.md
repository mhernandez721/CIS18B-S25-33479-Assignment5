# CIS18B-S25-33479-Assignment5

This project simulates a basic notification system where:
* It generates Messages
* Sends messages
* Responds to those back and forth

## Features
* Generic Notification system using <T>
* Observer Pattern
* Abstract Factory
* Builder Pattern
* Type Erasure Awareness


P.S. I decided to go a little experimental on how the program was structured, making a lot of files so it is easier to read for you and faster to troubleshoot for me. :)
